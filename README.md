# Multi-Robot-Logo-Drawing-in-Turtlesim-ROS2
This program illustrates a comprehensive approach to multi-robot control in a simulated environment, using PID controllers for navigation, ROS topics for communication, and services for environment management.

**Project Overview**
This project, titled "Robotics and Spatial Intelligence," focuses on the implementation of a multi-robot system designed to navigate predetermined paths that form the letters "A", "a", "T", and "M". Utilizing a simulated environment, the project explores concepts of motion control, communication, and navigation through the application of PID controllers, ROS topics, and services.

**Implementation Details**
PID Controllers: Utilized for precise navigation and control of the robots along the defined paths.
ROS Topics and Services: Facilitate communication between robots and manage environmental interactions, including dynamic goal assignment and pen control.
Modular Design: Ensures scalability and flexibility, allowing for the easy addition of new paths or changes in robot behavior.

**Challenges and Solutions**
Accurate path tracing was challenging due to PID controller tuning and decision logic. Solutions include fine-tuning of controller parameters and adjustment of tolerance values to improve navigation accuracy.

**Getting Started**
Instructions on setting up the environment, running the simulation, and interacting with the robots are provided to ensure users can replicate and build upon the project.

**Future Work**
Suggestions for future work include further optimization of controller parameters and exploration of alternative navigation strategies to enhance system performance.
